    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Since Isaac Newton's discovery of gravity and Einstein’s refinement of it through his **General Theory of Relativity**, gravity has been one of the cornerstones of modern physics. However, recent developments in cosmology and quantum mechanics suggest that our understanding of gravity may be incomplete or even wrong.</p>
    <p>The idea that **"We Got Gravity Wrong"** comes from the inability of our current models to explain certain cosmic phenomena, such as dark matter, dark energy, and the nature of black holes. This webpage will explore these issues and the alternative theories that seek to challenge our current understanding of gravity.</p>

<section id="current-model">
    <h2>Current Understanding of Gravity</h2>
    <p>According to **Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation**, gravity is the force of attraction between two masses. This idea was further developed by **Albert Einstein** in his **General Theory of Relativity**, where gravity is described not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.</p>
    <p>General relativity has been a highly successful theory, accurately predicting phenomena such as the bending of light near massive objects and the behavior of planets and stars. However, there are several key areas where this model of gravity falls short:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Dark Matter and Dark Energy:** Over 95% of the universe's mass-energy content is in forms that do not interact with light or ordinary matter in a way that we can detect. Dark matter and dark energy are mysterious entities that do not fit neatly into the framework of general relativity.</li>
        <li>**Quantum Gravity:** Einstein's theory works incredibly well on large scales (stars, galaxies), but breaks down at the quantum level. Gravity remains the only fundamental force not yet unified with quantum mechanics.</li>
        <li>**Black Hole Paradoxes:** At the core of black holes, general relativity predicts singularities—points of infinite density where the laws of physics break down. This suggests that our current understanding of gravity might be incomplete.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="alternatives">
    <h2>Alternative Theories of Gravity</h2>
    <p>Several alternative theories of gravity have been proposed to address the shortcomings of general relativity and Newtonian physics. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND):** MOND modifies Newton's law of gravity to account for galaxy rotation curves without invoking dark matter. In this model, gravity behaves differently on extremely large scales, which explains galactic motions better than classical Newtonian gravity.</li>
        <li>**Emergent Gravity:** Proposed by **Erik Verlinde**, emergent gravity suggests that gravity is not a fundamental force, but rather an emergent phenomenon arising from the entropic properties of spacetime. This theory also attempts to explain dark matter as an effect of emergent gravity.</li>
        <li>**Quantum Gravity (Loop Quantum Gravity and String Theory):** Quantum gravity attempts to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics. **Loop Quantum Gravity** discretizes spacetime into small loops, while **String Theory** proposes that gravity arises from vibrating strings in higher dimensions.</li>
        <li>**F(R) Gravity:** This theory generalizes Einstein's equations to include more complex relationships between curvature and gravity, potentially explaining the accelerated expansion of the universe (dark energy) without needing to add new mysterious components like dark energy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These alternative models each offer explanations for phenomena that current gravitational theory struggles with, but none have yet been universally accepted or confirmed by observation.</p>
</section>

<section id="evidence">
    <h2>Evidence and Challenges</h2>
    <p>The strongest pieces of evidence suggesting that our understanding of gravity might be wrong include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Galaxy Rotation Curves:** The rotation of galaxies suggests that there is more mass present than we can detect with ordinary matter. Dark matter was proposed to explain this, but MOND suggests that gravity itself behaves differently at these scales.</li>
        <li>**Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):** The CMB reveals information about the early universe, and discrepancies between observations and predictions hint at potential issues with our understanding of gravity on cosmic scales.</li>
        <li>**Gravitational Waves:** The recent detection of gravitational waves has confirmed some predictions of general relativity, but discrepancies in their propagation could point to new physics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, these alternative models also face challenges. Some have yet to make testable predictions that can be observed, while others contradict well-established experimental results in other areas of physics.</p>
