    <h2>Introduction to the Steady State Universe</h2>
    <p>The **Steady State Universe** is a cosmological model that was proposed as an alternative to the Big Bang Theory. According to this theory, the universe has always existed and will continue to exist in its current state. The universe is constantly expanding, but new matter is created as it expands, keeping its density constant over time. This idea stands in contrast to the Big Bang Theory, which asserts that the universe had a beginning and has been evolving ever since.</p>

    <h2>The Steady State Theory</h2>
    <p>The **Steady State Theory** was developed in 1948 by astronomers **Fred Hoyle**, **Thomas Gold**, and **Hermann Bondi**. The theory was based on the **perfect cosmological principle**, which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic in both space and time. This means that the universe looks the same not just in all directions (as in the standard cosmological principle) but also at all times.</p>
    <p>In order for the universe to maintain a constant density despite its expansion, the steady state theory proposes that new matter is continuously created at a rate just sufficient to offset the dilution caused by the universe’s expansion. This ongoing creation of matter ensures that the universe appears the same at all times, both on large and small scales.</p>
</section>

<section id="comparison">
    <h2>Steady State vs Big Bang</h2>
    <p>The **Steady State Theory** differs from the **Big Bang Theory** in several fundamental ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Cosmological Principle:** The Big Bang Theory assumes that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic in space, but not necessarily in time. In contrast, the Steady State Theory assumes homogeneity and isotropy in both space and time.</li>
        <li>**Origin of the Universe:** The Big Bang Theory suggests the universe had a definite beginning (the Big Bang) approximately 13.8 billion years ago. The Steady State Theory posits that the universe has no beginning or end—it has existed forever and will continue to exist in the same state.</li>
        <li>**Matter Creation:** In the Big Bang model, all matter was created at the moment of the Big Bang, and the universe has been expanding and evolving ever since. In the Steady State model, matter is continuously created as the universe expands, maintaining a constant density.</li>
        <li>**Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):** The discovery of the CMB, a faint glow of radiation left over from the early universe, strongly supports the Big Bang Theory, and it is difficult for the Steady State Theory to explain this observation.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="evidence">
    <h2>Observational Evidence and Challenges</h2>
    <p>When first proposed, the Steady State Theory was a serious competitor to the Big Bang Theory. However, over time, several key observations have favored the Big Bang model:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):** The CMB is one of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the Big Bang Theory. Discovered in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, the CMB is a remnant of the early universe, and it is difficult to explain within the framework of the Steady State Theory.</li>
        <li>**Galaxy Evolution:** Observations of distant galaxies show that the universe looked very different in the past than it does today, which contradicts the Steady State Theory's assertion that the universe looks the same at all times.</li>
        <li>**Element Abundances:** The relative abundances of hydrogen, helium, and other light elements in the universe are in line with predictions made by the Big Bang model, particularly from nucleosynthesis in the early universe. The Steady State Theory cannot easily account for these abundances.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Due to these observations, the Big Bang Theory has become the prevailing model of cosmology, while the Steady State Theory has fallen out of favor. However, the Steady State Theory remains an important historical model and is still of interest in some theoretical discussions.</p>
